Hi! This is my repo I am going to use to learn Scala!

Reasons to learn Scala:

1. It looks cool, and it will be the first JVM lang I am learning. 
2. New Apache Spark features come out in Scala first. 
3. My cousin-in-law once complained to me in 2017 that he preferred Scala to anything they were using at his current workplace, and typically he is a quiet guy, so that stuck with me. 

I am unsure of how far this repo will go, but if you're at all interested in my personal development; stay tuned!

Best,
Bradley
